The two have remained amicable through the years.&nbsp;</p><p>Then she met Javi Marroquin, who she married in 2012, and the pair welcomed Lincoln shortly after. The relationship did not last, and the pair divorced in 2017. Not too long after, Kailyn welcomed her son Lux with Chris Lopez. Their relationship was tumultuous, to say the least, but despite being on-again, off-again, they did another kid together: son Creed in July 2020.</p><p>Kailyn moved on with now boyfriend Elijah Scott after splitting from Chris, and they welcomed their first, Rio, in November 2022.</p><p>The following year, she revealed she was pregnant with twins with Elijah.</p><h2 id=h-kailyn-expecting-baby-8>Kailyn Expecting Baby #8?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/classic-kailyn-1.jpg><p>But she’s not done yet –<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> or is she</a>?

During a recent episode of Kailyn’s Barely Famous podcast, the pair revealed a plan they hatched for the MTV bestie to carry a child for the ex reality TV personality.</p><p>“You just know when you’re not done having kids and you know when you are done having kids. So there was a point where I had said that I was not done having children – we’re gonna do gender selection – and then Bone was going to carry my children or child,” the mom-of-seven said.</p><p>She went on: “An Elijah [Scott] was on board. I don’t know if your boyfriend was on board.” Bone then revealed that she “had already agreed to it” when she met her new man and had no plans to back out of the deal if that was something Kailyn wanted.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tsX2V%2BcLfAoqOypl2hvLi%2B2GaiopyjZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
