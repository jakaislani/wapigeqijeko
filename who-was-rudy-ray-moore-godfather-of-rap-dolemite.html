Moore, who died at the age of 81 in 2008, is now seen as a cultural pioneer, revered by the likes of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/snoop-dogg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Snoop Dogg" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Snoop Dogg</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/dr-dre data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr. Dre" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dr. Dre</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Now the often outlandish personality is being revered in the biopic film Dolemite is My Name, a passion project of actor <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/eddie-murphy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Eddie Murphy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Eddie Murphy</a>.

In his teens, he was singing and dancing in a genre of African American bars called <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tiff.net/the-review/dolemite-rudy-ray-moore data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“black and tan” clubs" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">“black and tan” clubs</a>, often showcasing sexy dancers and raunchy comedians.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Moore was drafted in 1950 and served as part of the military’s entertainment unit in Germany, where he sang country songs in an R&B style as the Harlem Hillbilly. Back in the U.S., he tried to invigorate his music career, as a turbaned dancer named Prince Dumarr, as well as by recording songs like “Hully Gully Papa.” Calling himself the “King of the Party Records,” he fine-tuned the genre of mixing funk music and street rhymes that eventually became hip-hop.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As a struggling musician, he also worked at an L.A. record store Dolphin’s of Hollywood. He wasn’t having any luck, so Moore looked everywhere for inspiration — until it simply walked in the door in 1970. A regular customer named Rico would charge a few dollars to tell stories about an outrageous pimp named Dolemite (derived from the mineral dolomite), in rhyme. Moore was so bemused by the tales that he invited Rico over and recorded some of his stories, which he turned into standup comedy routines.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Dolemite' was called 'the Citizen Kane of kung fu pimping movies'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The first album featuring Dolemite, called Eat Out More Often, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tiff.net/the-review/dolemite-rudy-ray-moore data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="has been described" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">has been described</a> as a “blend of dirty jokes and funk groove overdubs that became a surprise hit on the Billboard soul charts.” Finding his niche, Moore continued releasing albums with titles like The Player – The Hustler and Close Encounter of the Sex Kind.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">They saw underground success, but were so X-rated, often with nude and suggestive cover photographs, that they far surpassed what had already seemed extreme as set forth by comedians of the time like Red Foxx and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/richard-pryor data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Richard Pryor" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Richard Pryor</a>. In fact, they <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tiff.net/the-review/dolemite-rudy-ray-moore data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="were reportedly" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">were reportedly</a> often sold “under the counter, delivered to the customer in a plain brown wrapper.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Determined to break through to the mainstream, Moore used his profits from the albums to fund a movie version of Dolemite, released in 1975, which <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newsweek.com/who-rudy-ray-moore-dolemite-eddie-murphy-name-movie-1453905 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New York Times" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The New York Times</a> called "the Citizen Kane of kung fu pimping movies” in 2002. The film — along with its sequels 1976’s The Human Tornado and 2002’s The Return of Dolemite (also known as The Dolemite Explosion) — were a trifecta of exploits, testing the boundaries of sex, violence and vulgar language, and, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tiff.net/the-review/dolemite-rudy-ray-moore data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="called by some" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">called by some</a>, the “best bad movies.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A sampling of the language from the first movie’s trailer captures its essence: "I've got an all-girl army who knows what to do. They're foxy as hell and practice kung fu. I'll put my finger in the ground and turn the whole world around."</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Moore is known as the Godfather of Rap</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While he broke ground in the blaxploitation film scene, one of the most lasting effects of his influence goes back to where he started: music.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Setting the precedent for mixing beats and rhyme, he earned the nickname the Godfather of Rap, for having helped birth the genre, with Busta Rhymes, Beastie Boys, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, 2 Live Crew and Wu-Tang Clan’s Ol’ Dirty Bastard all having been profoundly influenced by Moore’s style.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Snoop Dogg even wrote in the liner notes in a 2006 soundtrack release of the original Dolemite, “Without Rudy Ray Moore, there would be no Snoop Dogg, and that’s for real.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But Moore’s most known rhyme is for sure <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/movies/22moore.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="his signature line" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">his signature line</a>: “Dolemite is my name and rappin’ and tappin’, that’s my game.
