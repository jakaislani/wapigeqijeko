Following this, he starred in Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure and its sequel, Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey.</p><p>These films began his acting career, but his subsequent film choices received unfavorable feedback. It wasn’t until The Devil’s Advocate that he started getting strong box office reviews.</p><p>Reeves has also dabbled in filmmaking, beginning with Man of Tai Chi in 2013.
