Sometimes rendering programs end up being heavily memory dependent as well - when you have that many threads flying about with a ton of data, having low latency memory can be key to everything. Here we take a few of the usual rendering packages under Windows 10, as well as a few new interesting benchmarks.</p><p>All of our benchmark results can also be found in our benchmark engine, <a href=#>Bench</a>.</p><h3><strong>Corona 1.3: <a href=#>link</a></strong></h3><p>Corona is a standalone package designed to assist software like 3ds Max and Maya with photorealism via ray tracing. It's simple - shoot rays, get pixels. OK, it's more complicated than that, but the benchmark renders a fixed scene six times and offers results in terms of time and rays per second. The official benchmark tables list user submitted results in terms of time, however I feel rays per second is a better metric (in general, scores where higher is better seem to be easier to explain anyway). Corona likes to pile on the threads, so the results end up being very staggered based on thread count.</p><p align=center><img alt="Rendering: Corona Photorealism" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph12725/97971.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><strong>Blender 2.78: <a href=#>link</a></strong></h3><p>For a render that has been around for what seems like ages, Blender is still a highly popular tool. We managed to wrap up a standard workload into the February 5 nightly build of Blender and measure the time it takes to render the first frame of the scene. Being one of the bigger open source tools out there, it means both AMD and Intel work actively to help improve the codebase, for better or for worse on their own/each other's microarchitecture.</p><p align=center><img alt="Rendering: Blender 2.78" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph12725/97972.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This is one multi-threaded test where the 8-core Skylake-based Intel processor wins against the new AMD Ryzen 7 2700X; the variable threaded nature of Blender means that the mesh architecture and memory bandwidth work well here. On a price/parity comparison, the Ryzen 7 2700X easily takes the win from the top performers. Users with the Core i7-6700K are being easily beaten by the Ryzen 5 2600.</p><h3><strong>LuxMark v3.1: <a href=#>Link</a></strong></h3><p>As a synthetic, LuxMark might come across as somewhat arbitrary as a renderer, given that it's mainly used to test GPUs, but it does offer both an OpenCL and a standard C++ mode. In this instance, aside from seeing the comparison in each coding mode for cores and IPC, we also get to see the difference in performance moving from a C++ based code-stack to an OpenCL one with a CPU as the main host.</p><p align=center><img alt="Rendering: LuxMark CPU C++" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph12725/97973.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br><img alt="Rendering: LuxMark CPU OpenCL" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph12725/97974.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><strong>POV-Ray 3.7.1b4: <a href=#>link</a></strong></h3><p>Another regular benchmark in most suites, POV-Ray is another ray-tracer but has been around for many years. It just so happens that during the run up to AMD's Ryzen launch, the code base started to get active again with developers making changes to the code and pushing out updates. Our version and benchmarking started just before that was happening, but given time we will see where the POV-Ray code ends up and adjust in due course.</p><p align=center><img alt="Rendering: POV-Ray 3.7" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph12725/97975.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><strong>Cinebench R15: <a href=#>link</a></strong></h3><p>The latest version of CineBench has also become one of those 'used everywhere' benchmarks, particularly as an indicator of single thread performance. High IPC and high frequency gives performance in ST, whereas having good scaling and many cores is where the MT test wins out.</p><p align=center><img alt="Rendering: CineBench 15 SingleThreaded" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph12725/97976.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br><img alt="Rendering: CineBench 15 MultiThreaded" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph12725/97977.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Intel is still the single thread champion in benchmarks like CineBench, but it would appear that the Ryzen 7 2700X is now taking the lead in the multithreaded test.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH5zgpFuZpqllGLApq%2FOp5tmn5WjsrOt06Kmp2WirsemuoxwZGtvYGXFbn6WaWdmqqmvsq95lGZpb2hgrXpzgo9pZmpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
