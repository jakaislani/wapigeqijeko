The bearded operative is joined by American partner Marty, stealthily raiding a chemical weapons plant while their remote support team keeps track of them. I don’t watch the television series “Scorpion” regularly, honest I don’t, but this opener feels like an episode of that show with the “wacky” characters excised. That is, a tense woman in front of a computer (<a href=#>Gemma Chan</a>) instructs Stratton and Marty as the “tension” mounts and the inevitable cry of “We have no choice! Just send in the chopper!” is sounded.</p><p>Back home on his lonesome, Stratton licks his wounds on his houseboat, from which his now ex-girlfriend has disembarked. No worries: he has an eccentric hard-drinking neighbor (<a href=#>Derek Jacobi</a>) on a neighboring boat. I think these guys are standard issue for British intelligence agents. Back at the office, Stratton reports to female boss Sumner, whose authority is immediately undercut for the viewer on account of her being portrayed on an elliptical exercise machine when Stratton walks in. There’s all sorts of bad news. The guy who led an armed attack on Stratton and the now-absent Marty is a long-thought-dead Russian operative with whom Sumner (poor <a href=#>Connie Nielsen</a>) was once romantically involved. Also, there’s a mole in the SBS offices, whose identity you’ll guess as soon as the actor who plays him walks into a frame. And there’s a terrorist attack in the offing. Target: they don’t know yet. Oh, wait, a little while later they find out. Oh, no. It’s London.</p><p>This really is a paint-by-numbers action movie with two good things going for it. Those are brevity—it’s only 93 minutes long—and immediate forgetability. This latter quality, I allow, is only considered good by a certain class of people, those who feel overly beleaguered. Given that this is a movie reaching our screens in a time when people are just plain tired, and perhaps dreading the travails of the year ahead, an aggressively unimposing movie such as this might not be the worst time-waster. But it’s still a time-waster.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46sq6uZpKm8r3mRaWhx</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
