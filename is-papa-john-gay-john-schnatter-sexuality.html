However, it is safe to say that the entrepreneur’s sexuality is straight.</p><p>Schnatter walked down the aisle with Annette Cox on 11 April 1987 and lived in Anchorage, Kentucky. John’s ex-wife filed for divorce on 5 December 2019.</p><p>Cox disclosed that she had been separated from John for eight months (April 2019). She wrote that the marriage was irretrievably broken.</p><p>As <a href=# rel=noopener>reported by Heavy</a>, John Schnatter’s ex-wife owns a Papa John’s franchise in Louisville. She has been highly involved in the business with her husband and has owned the franchise since the late 1980s.</p><p>While operating under Papa John’s brand name, the Company is registered as Joe K Corporation. It employs fewer than 50 individuals. Moreover, the annual report submitted in June 2019 reveals that the franchise earns nearly $1 million annually.</p><h2>John Schnatter Admired His Wife A Lot</h2><p>John Schnatter and his former wife, Annette, had been together since the early days of Papa Johns’s. The former couple got hitched three years after selling pizza out of the converted broom closet.</p><p>In an interview in 2013, the entrepreneur praised Cox as the finest human being he had ever met. John added that Annette is the best franchise operator in Papa John’s system.

Better Pizza. Papa Johns.”</p><p>Since the founding of Papa John’s pizza in 1984, the Company grew insanely until the early 2010s. John Schnatter’s downfall with the pizza Company began in 2012.</p><p>The entrepreneur publicly criticized the Affordable Care Act. The storm passed shortly. However, another one brewed in 2017 after he blamed NFL openly for his Company’s poor financial performance.</p><p>As a result, John stepped down as CEO in early 2018. He continued to remain chairman of the board until July 2018.
