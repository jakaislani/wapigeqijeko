She also added that for her, bows symbolize&nbsp;"power, confidence, believing-ness."</p><p>Naturally, Siwa has transformed her bow obsession to a business and has launched her own line. Her bows have become so popular among young school girls that it's reportedly become a source of disruption in the classroom and has inspired competitors to issue similar and less expensive versions.</p><h2 id=tv-and-film>TV and Film</h2><h3 id=lip-sync-battle-shorties>'Lip Sync Battle Shorties'</h3><p>Following her early reality TV work, Siwa began appearing on kids shows like Bizaardvark, The Thundermans and School of Rock.
