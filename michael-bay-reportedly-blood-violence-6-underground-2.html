Sure, the story was convoluted and the characters paper thin, but the set pieces were exhilarating and the movie as a whole delivered a healthy dose of adrenaline fuelled entertainment.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>The combination of Bayhem and Ryan Reynolds resulted in big numbers, too, with 6 Underground the fourth most-watched Netflix original film in the company’s history, <a href=# rel=noopener>with 83 million views in the first four weeks it was available</a> to stream. Admittedly, the hype around it died out pretty quickly after that, but talk of a sequel has never been too far away and in recent weeks, we’ve been hearing more and more <a href=# rel=noopener>about what the follow-up may involve</a>.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maxresdefault-63.jpg alt="6 Underground" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>Of course, plot details remain scarce, but we’ve now learned from our sources – the same ones who said <a href=# rel=noopener>Netflix was developing</a> an&nbsp;Extraction&nbsp;sequel – that&nbsp;6 Underground 2&nbsp;will <a href=# rel=noopener>remain in R-rated territory</a> and that Bay is pushing for a lot more blood and violence in the next outing. And while it’s not like the original was a family-friendly affair, it certainly sounds like this next effort in the burgeoning franchise will be taking things a bit further in terms of the action.</p><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=false>As mentioned above, details on the story are still non-existent, but given that no one is interested in this particular property for its plot, that really doesn’t matter. People loved&nbsp;<strong>6 Underground&nbsp;</strong>for its wild set pieces and charismatic cast, and it appears as if both of those things will be kept in tact for the sequel, with a recent report saying that <a href=# rel=noopener>all the main players</a> from the original will return for what’s sure to be another hugely enjoyable ride.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopKKbmJayrXnBmrBmqpWlvLPAxJ2jsmWSobywsIyvoKiklaOwpnmVZqynnJWntLO71KebZmpf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
