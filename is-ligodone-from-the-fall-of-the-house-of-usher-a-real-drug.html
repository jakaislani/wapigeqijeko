Not technically, but it is more complicated than that.

It’s natural to wonder if the drug is a real one, with how much it is discussed in the television series. Ligodone is a fictional opioid medication produced by the (also fictional) Fortunato company.</p><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=831 data-injectable=true>Roderick Usher and his sister Madeline created the drug and had it go to market in 1980. With the similarities and release date, Ligodone can be seen as being represented by one of two (or both) popular opioid medicines. Both Vicodin and Oxycontin have had a colorful past and present with causing addiction and widespread suffering for those who became dependent on the medications. The two are also at the center of the current <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">opioid epidemic</a> that has taken many lives.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What does Ligodone represent in The Fall of the House of Usher?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/TFHU_102_Unit_03545RC-EMBED-2023.jpg><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=754 data-injectable=true>While Ligodone is not a real medication, there are several just like it in the real world. The story of Ligodone is less about the specific drug itself, but more about the intense suffering and pain brought on by the pharmaceutical industry’s historical negligence around opioids. Drugs like Vicodin, Oxycontin, Opana, and Sublimaze have all contributed to the current opioid epidemic that has plagued both the United States and global population.</p><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=false>It can be debated how much the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pharmaceutical industry</a> is responsible for individual addiction and abuse of drugs, as we see it discussed many times in The Fall of the House of Usher. The bigger issue is that many of the medications were initially marketed as non-addictive and pushed aggressively onto patients who suffered from chronic pain. From there, many medicine manufacturing companies, like the fictional Fortunato, made billions of dollars off the dependency of millions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4yloKCnlKS7pnnFq6amZaSdsm6ywKWjZqeWYsGpsYyhpq6rlWK8p3nUrJ%2Beql2WerOxwKVknaqlnHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
