The show is launching in Columbia, S.C. at the Township Auditorium on Jan. 19 and wrapping up March 3 in Los Angeles’&nbsp;Microsoft Theater.</p><p>Several fans shared their excitement about seeing the&nbsp;“Seven Whole Days” singer on the road.</p><p>“I’m ready to see you Ms. Toni Braxton&nbsp;😍”</p><p>“We can’t wait to see you here in Houston, TX!!!”</p><p>“@tonibraxtonnn omg I can’t wait to see what her wardrobe for the tour looks like either. I already know she’s gonna look gorgeous as always 😩😍”</p><p>“It’s workin,&nbsp;an you’re ready, have a Great Tour, hope to see you in the Ville😄”</p><p>But others wondered about her impending nuptials to Birdman. The last major update fans got about it was during the last season of “<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Braxton Family Values</strong></a>.”</p><p>“What about the wedding 👰”</p><p>“What about this wedding huuuuuuuh….. love it always beautiful a classic!!!”</p><p>“OK but um are you married? Are you still engaged? Do you even really wanna marry him? You got cold feet because you already been down this road? Like wassup Toni #thefanswanttoknow because you stay booked and busy.”</p><p>“WHEN’S THE WEDDING?”</p><p>“Hey beautiful so..when’s the wedding???❤️❤️❤️❤️💍”</p><p>Braxton got engaged to Birdman in September 2017 and after avoiding confirming the news, she made things clear in a teaser for BFV released back in February. But by the time the show returned to airwaves in April, fans and her family learned she and her fiancé would not wed in August as previously expected.</p><p>“B and I got engaged seven months ago, but we haven’t set a date because of my schedule,” she said on the show. “I hate that. You’re supposed to set a date and stick to it. But unfortunately, in our business, it can be challenging sometimes.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX55e5BqZmprX6m8r7WMm6masKSku26t1aignatdlru0w8SroKefXabCpr%2FToqanq12Wr7DB02aunpyUnruoecGiqZ2lkaN6orLTnqlmqJ%2Bowaq6xmaYm6elqXq1u9SrZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
