Davies,&nbsp;expands with its thoughtful plotting, giving room to different experiences, especially as everyone has curiously&nbsp;different reactions to the growing threat of AIDS. Jill becomes an advocate while balancing time as a stage actor; Roscoe seeks opportunities to elevate his financial status in a goofy subplot involving <a href=#>Stephen Fry</a>; innocent roomie Colin (Callum Scott Howells) tries to make it through his job without getting harassed by his boss. These stories can risk not having enough momentum, but you follow along especially with the strength of the performances. They each create flesh-and-blood characters with their internal dreams, especially Olly Alexander's ebullient performance as wannabe star Richie, or West putting a stoic front to Jill's&nbsp;unwavering empathy for other people’s pain during such a time. The series nearly belongs to those two—and you can practically imagine a two-hour cut that favors them heavily—but the other characters add sincere details about what it would be like to be a gay man in such a repressed, hateful climate.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the series’ biggest weapon proves to be its montages. All of the characters’ lives come together in these high energy&nbsp;sequences, filled with pride about being&nbsp;at a certain age at a certain time. It’s where the series’ period specific needle-drops can shine too, with music from Wham!, Kate Bush, <a href=#>Belinda Carlisle</a>, and of course The Pet Shop Boys. Just the same, “It’s a Sin” knows how to take our breath away with a sudden cutting of the music, like in how it ends its&nbsp;first two episodes on grave dramatic beats. The sudden changes are heavily effective in highlighting tragedy, as some vibrant characters are depicted&nbsp;succumbing to the disease.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/602f2776b8b50d4b5d42b041/content_its-a-sin-tv-review-2.jpg><p>“It’s a Sin” is essentially a radiant coming-of-age story balanced with the sense that the party could end sooner than later. It's an often&nbsp;potent mix between that&nbsp;sense of feeling totally alive amongst your friends, especially at such an independent age, with&nbsp;the gravity of an epidemic that they don’t understand, that they aren’t informed about. Resilience becomes one of the story’s main spectacles, especially in how Richie, Roscoe, Jill, Colin, Ash and others&nbsp;seek to defy all of the various forces that threaten to muddle their deepest goals.&nbsp;But as each episode features a stunning character death, the shadows feel darker and the moments of light feel even brighter.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrKyimq6utc2gZqKso2Kubr%2FIp2Shmp9iwbd50Z6top2n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
