You save some money (always a win), and, 2.) You get to find some of the wildest candy you’d actually still want to eat. Seriously, Dollar Tree’s specialty is familiar flavors in new formats, so let’s not beat around the bush (where all of the Easter eggs are hidden) and talk about some of the most fun Easter candy I spotted at Dollar Tree on a recent visit. Oh, and if you can’t make it to Dollar Tree but still want some hoppin’ good Easter candy, check out our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-easter-candy/>best Easter candy</a> on shelves this year.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kellogg’s Froot Loops Jelly Beans</strong></a><p>I mean…I tried to prepare you. Freaking Froot Loops jelly beans?! I need to try these. In fact, I did and they taste exactly like the real deal. Whether you’ve been dying to try the jelly bean form of Froot Loops for $1.25 or you want to surprise unsuspecting colleagues who tend to pluck goodies from your desk candy dish at work, this is a steal!</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kellogg’s Rice Krispies Cereal ‘N Milk Chocolate Bunny</strong></a><p>Plain <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-chocolate-easter-bunny/>chocolate Easter bunnies</a> are so 2000 and late! Let’s mix things up with this Rice Krispies-infused version. Realistically, this will probably taste like a Crunch bar, but, hey, Crunch bars are good so I’m willing to bet this is, too. Grab one from Dollar Tree while you stock up on the truly wild creations they’re putting out for Easter.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Frankford Cookies ‘N Creme Easter Bunny</strong></a><p>Let’s take a break from the oddities and get into something we know will be good. Cookies and cream, in my totally unbiased opinion, is an elite flavor, so any chance to get more of it is a good thing, and this bunny-shaped block of white chocolate is the perfect vessel. Sure, it’s a little small, but you’re going to eat it in one sitting anyway, so throw it in the basket!</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Now and Later Jelly Beans</strong></a><p>Okay, we gave you a bit of a break from the Easter freakiness to be found in Dollar Tree, but we’re back in business with these Now and Later jelly beans. At first blush, Now and Later jelly beans don’t seem too weird, but I do have some questions. Who thought Now and Later, of all candies, needed a jelly bean version? If you’re the one singular person who thought to ask for that, get in your car and rush to Dollar Tree right now! For all others, feel free to buy a bag simply to fulfill your curiosity.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Candy Coated Tootsie Roll Eggs</strong></a><p>I loved Tootsie Rolls growing up. I stopped eating them to preserve my fillings, but I’m willing to risk it all for these Easter eggs. That’s ingenuity. I imagine these are akin to M&M’s, just with a greater chance of sticking to your teeth. I truly can’t pass up trying something that even flicks a micron of curiosity in my brain when it only costs a buck twenty five at Dollar Tree, so I have to recommend these.</p><a href=#><strong>Peeps Sour Watermelon Chicks</strong></a><p>I know these Peeps look like another oddity, but I promise they’re vouched for. Against all odds, Peeps sour watermelon chicks were the Sporked crew’s second favorite <a href=#>Peeps flavor</a> of all the Peeps flavors they tasted and ranked. I had to check three times that the list was in the right order. Sour Watermelon? Really? If it’s too much for you, I’m pleased to report that the other two flavors I found at Dollar Tree—Party Cake and Wild Berry—placed third and sixth, respectively.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Junior Mints Eggs</strong></a><p>Admittedly, this isn’t the most creative Easter candy at Dollar Tree, but it’s a must-buy for any Junior Mints freaks out there. I know there are a lot of you; I can’t stop hearing about this candy’s “superiority” every time I go to the movies. I’ll let you have this one for Easter, then I don’t want to hear about it until next year.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Reese’s Milk Chocolate Snack Size Peanut Butter Eggs</strong></a><p>Okay, okay. We’ve regaled you with a bunch of weird and wild Easter candy here, and your reward for sticking it out? The ultimate Easter candy. Everyone knows that Reese’s Eggs are basically the best Reese’s candy of them all, not to be confused with the inferior <a href=# rel=noopener>foil-wrapped eggs</a> they also offer. There is no correct number of these to grab, but they’re only $1.25 each at Dollar Tree, so a dozen seems like the bare minimum.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJ2RqMGmvoycmKecqWKutXnDqKOlmaJiwbOxxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
