Tracy Chapman Now: Folk Singer Surprises with 2024 Grammys Performance In perhaps the most unexpected moment at the 2024 Grammy Awards, folk singer Tracy Chapman, 59, made a rare public appearance to perform her song “Fast Car” with country musician Luke Combs. The 33-year-old country star released a cover of the track nearly a year ago. It went platinum in July 2023 before becoming a No. 1 country hit in September, making Chapman the first Black woman with a sole songwriting credit on a chart-topping country tune."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The song’s resurgence in the past year earned Chapman a 2023 CMA Award for Song of the Year, as Combs won for Single of the Year. “It’s truly an honor for my song to be newly recognized 35 years after its debut,” she said in a statement that was read on her behalf at the November ceremony. The folk singer last toured in 2009 and has only performed on camera three times since, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2024/music/news/tracy-chapman-luke-combs-grammys-perform-1235891995/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to Variety" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">according to Variety</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 title="Who Is Tracy Chapman?" data-anchor-id=who-is-tracy-chapman class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Who Is Tracy Chapman?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Four-time Grammy winner Tracy Chapman began writing music and performing in Boston, where she recorded songs at the WMFO radio station. She caught her big break in 1986, when a friend’s father introduced her to a manager at Elektra Records. Her self-titled album released in 1988. The album’s most popular single, “Fast Car,” landed at No. 5 on the U.K. charts and No. 6 on the U.S. charts. Several years later, Chapman released New Beginning, another widely acclaimed album, which was carried by the hit song “Give Me One Reason.” Although that 1995 success has yet to be matched, Chapman stays busy as an activist, speaking and performing on behalf of various organizations.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Tracy Chapman<br>BORN: March 30, 1964<br>BIRTHPLACE: Cleveland, Ohio<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Aries<br></p><h2 data-node-id=10 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Tracy Chapman was born in Cleveland on March 30, 1964. At a young age, she moved with her family to Connecticut. While attending Tufts University in Massachusetts, studying anthropology and African studies, Chapman began writing music and performing in Boston and recorded songs at the local WMFO radio station.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 title="Musical Career: Songs and Albums" data-anchor-id=musical-career-songs-and-albums class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Musical Career: Songs and Albums</h2><img alt="tracy chapman, wearing a black dress and sunglasses, stands on an outdoor stage and sings into a microphone while holding an acoustic guitar" title="Tracy Chapman performing in November 1991" width=3000 height=2082 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tracy-chapman-performs-at-laughter-love-and-music-a-tribute-news-photo-1694103028.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Tracy Chapman performs at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco in November 1991.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Chapman caught her big break in 1986 when a friend’s father introduced her to a manager at Elektra Records—with whom she recorded her first self-titled album that was released in 1988. Tracy Chapman rose to No. 1 in both the United States and the United Kingdom, and its popular single, “Fast Car,” landed at No. 5 on the U.K. charts and No. 6 on the U.S. charts. That same year, Chapman performed at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/nelson-mandela data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nelson Mandela" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Nelson Mandela</a>’s 70th Birthday Tribute Concert, which was held in Great Britain. The album’s second single, “Talkin’ ’Bout a Revolution,” also met with wide acclaim and earned rank on Billboard’s music charts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The musician received several honors following the release of Tracy Chapman, including three Grammy Awards in 1989. She won Best New Artist, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for “Fast Car,” and Best Contemporary Folk Recording.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Becoming a three-time Grammy winner is quite an accomplishment for any musician’s first project, but Chapman didn’t waste any time before working on her next one. Between performing songs from her Grammy Award–winning album, she continued to write and make rounds back to the studio to record Crossroads (1989), which she also co-produced. Chapman dedicated one song on the album, “Freedom Now,” to Mandela. Although the album didn’t receive the same acclaim as her first, it did find a place on the Billboard 200, as well as other industry charts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The singer-songwriter’s musical success again slightly dipped in 1992, with the release of Matters of the Heart, an album that peaked at No. 53 on the Billboard 200 and failed to receive any real international fame. Matters of the Heart included less memorable songs than Chapman’s previous projects, and fans were put off by her straying from folk and blues to a more upbeat, alternative-rock sound.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Three years later, the tune of things changed upon the release of Chapman’s fourth studio album. As the album’s title suggests, New Beginning (1995) proved to be a step back into the limelight for the musician, selling nearly 5 million copies in the United States alone. The album far exceeded the appeal of Chapman’s previous projects, thanks to the widely popular single “Give Me One Reason,” as well as such catchy, soulful tunes as “Smoke and Ashes” and the album’s title track, “New Beginning.” Chapman received her fourth Grammy Award in 1997—this time for Best Rock Song (“Give Me One Reason”)—as well as several Grammy nominations and other music awards.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Chapman’s 1995 success has yet to be matched. Since New Beginning’s release, the musician has released a handful of albums, including Telling Stories (2000) and Our Bright Future (2008), and toured through 2009. In recent years, however, Chapman has largely stayed out of the spotlight.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 title="2023 CMA Award for “Fast Car”" data-anchor-id=2023-cma-award-for-fast-car class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">2023 CMA Award for “Fast Car”</h2><img alt="luke combs on a stage singing into a microphone, standing in front of a set of drums, wearing a black shit, jeans, and a white baseball cap" title="Luke Combs in June 2023" width=4165 height=2777 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/luke-combs-performs-on-stage-during-day-one-of-cma-fest-news-photo-1694102970.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Country singer Luke Combs, seen performing in June 2023, achieved great success with his cover of Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Chapman experienced a resurgence of interest and popularity when country musician Luke Combs released a cover version of “Fast Car” in April 2023.

During a 2003 event to benefit Circle of Life, Chapman performed a memorable duet with Bonnie Raitt, of the John Prine song “Angel From Montgomery.”</p>Fact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
