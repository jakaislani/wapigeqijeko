She engaged in a civil war with her brother Ptolemy XIII for the control of the crown and ultimately combined forces with Julius Caesar to claim victory <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.worldhistory.org/Ptolemy_XIII_Theos_Philopator/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="during the Battle of the Nile" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>during the Battle of the Nile</u></a>. Ptolemy XIII died shortly after in 47 BCE.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cleopatra arranged for Mark Antony to execute her half-sister Arsinoe IV for her role in a siege against Cleopatra’s forces, according to the book Cleopatra by Michael Grant. She is also widely believed to have poisoned her 15-year-old brother Ptolemy XIV so that her son, Caesarion, could replace him as pharaoh, according to the Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">She had public relations skills</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While clearly capable of brutality when necessary, Cleopatra was equally known for her charisma. In fact, Shannon Bowen, a professor at the School of Journalism and Mass Communications at the University of South Carolina, argues Cleopatra was a master of what today <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/cic/journalism_and_mass_communications/news/2016/pr_prose_cleopatra_queen_of_pr.php#.ZFqi7uzMI0Q data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="would be considered public relations" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>would be considered public relations</u></a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cleopatra garnered appreciation from her subjects by holding public forums, providing information about agriculture and commerce, and hosting events with performers, animals, and free food for spectators. “She had a way of making people feel at ease and was able to win over even the most skeptical of individuals with her wit and charm,” Bowen wrote. “This made her an effective leader, as she was able to inspire loyalty and respect from those around her.”</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">She formed important strategic alliances</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Throughout her reign, Cleopatra formed partnerships with powerful allies to position herself and her kingdom for maximum advantage. Perhaps her most famous such alliance was with Julius Caesar, with whom she had both a political allegiance and romantic affair, which gave her the military strength she needed to dethrone her brother and seize the Egyptian crown.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following Caesar’s assassination in 44 BCE, Cleopatra married his successor and key ally, Mark Antony, who formed part of the three-man Second Triumvirate that ruled Rome. Both <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/cleopatra-mark-antony-love-story-death data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="benefited from this relationship" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>benefited from this relationship</u></a>, with Antony receiving financial and military support from Cleopatra, who in turn sought Antony’s help in expanding Egypt’s eastern border.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">She was a risk-taker</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cleopatra didn’t hesitate to make bold moves or calculated risks for the benefit of her power or her kingdom. One famous example was approaching Caesar on the island of Antirhodos to propose an alliance, despite losing her civil war against Ptolemy XIII at the time. Films about Cleopatra, from the 1934 movie starring Claudette Colbert to the better-known 1963 biopic starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/elizabeth-taylor data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elizabeth Taylor" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Elizabeth Taylor</a>, depict her being secretly smuggled to Caesar inside a rolled up carpet. That story is <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://albertis-window.com/2015/02/cleopatra-carpet-myth/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="largely a myth" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>largely a myth</u></a>, but nevertheless, Cleopatra’s willingness to make those overtures to Caesar speaks to her calculating and risk-taking nature.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">She was charming, if not beautiful</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although Cleopatra is often portrayed as stunningly beautiful, historians say that wasn’t necessarily the case. Greek biographer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.britannica.com/story/what-did-cleopatra-look-like data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Plutarch wrote" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>Plutarch wrote</u></a> “for her beauty, as we are told, was in itself not altogether incomparable, nor such as to strike those who saw her.” Likewise, The National Inquirer infamously reported in a 2000 article that Cleopatra <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/20/arts/cleopatra-career-woman.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="had a “big schnozz.”" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>had a “big schnozz.”</u></a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But while Cleopatra might not have been the seductive temptress the way we’ve seen in the movies, even Plutarch noted she had an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.britannica.com/story/what-did-cleopatra-look-like data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“irresistible charm”" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>“irresistible charm”</u></a> as well as a sweet voice, persuasive nature, and stimulating presence. The New York Times described her as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/20/arts/cleopatra-career-woman.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="unafraid to show her age or blemishes" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>unafraid to show her age or blemishes</u></a>, noting coins with her image did not attempt to conceal her wrinkles.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">She was skilled at naval tactics</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cleopatra was the first queen of Greek descent to be a skilled naval commander since Artemisia of Halicarnassus more than four centuries earlier, according to Roller. Cleopatra commanded a formidable fleet, which she personally brought to Greece to assist Mark Antony in his conflict with Caesar’s assassin Cassius, according to Burstein.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Octavian, the future Roman emperor, did manage to defeat the naval fleet of Cleopatra and Antony during the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE. Based on this, Cleopatra has sometimes been called a poor naval commander, but historian Barry Strauss argued that is undeserved, noting she was able to save much of the fleet despite being outnumbered and coping with poor weather.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Watch Queen Cleopatra on Netflix</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Queen Cleopatra is executive produced by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jada-pinkett-smith data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jada Pinkett Smith" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jada Pinkett Smith</a> and features actor Adele James as Cleopatra in reenactment scenes.
