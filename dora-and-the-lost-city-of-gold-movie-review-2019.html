Director <a href=#>James Bobin</a> and co-writer <a href=#>Nicholas Stoller</a>, who previously collaborated on the most recent “Muppets” movies, achieve a similar sense of humor and tonal balance here. They’re making fun of the inherently surreal nature of the show without tipping all the way over into parody or cruelty. They recognize how insane it is that Dora’s friends include a talking backpack and map, for example, or that her chief adversary in the jungle, Swiper, is a fox wearing a bandit’s mask. But they also see the importance of celebrating a strong, confident little girl with a kind heart, resourceful mind and fearless spirit.</p><p>Pulling off this tricky feat at the center of it all is the actress playing Dora herself, the magnetic <a href=#>Isabela Moner</a>, whose performance is reminiscent of <a href=#>Amy Adams</a>’ thoroughly delightful work in “<a href=#>Enchanted</a>.” She’s giddy and guileless—borderline manic at times—and she has an unflappably sunny demeanor no matter the scenario. Whether she’s encountering a deadly, poisonous frog or digging a hole to help a friend relieve herself in the wilderness, she’s got a can-do attitude and likely a song for every occasion. But Moner is also in on the joke, bringing expert comic timing and just the right amount of a knowing wink to these perky proceedings. Following supporting roles in films including “<a href=#>Transformers: The Last Knight</a>” and “<a href=#>Sicario: Day of the Soldado</a>,” this is a star-making performance—so much so that it makes you wish the whole film were as good as she is.</p><p>Dora has grown up in the Peruvian rainforest with her zoologist mother (<a href=#>Eva Longoria</a>) and archaeologist father (<a href=#>Michael Peña</a>). It’s an idyllic existence that has sharpened her wits and fostered her curiosity, but it hasn’t exactly made her street smart. In fact, she’s never really had any other friends her age—or human friends, period—besides her cousin Diego, whom she hasn’t seen since she was a little girl. Now that she’s a teenager, her parents have decided to send her to Los Angeles to attend high school with Diego (Jeff Wahlberg) while they go on a dangerous mission to find the elusive, mysterious Parapata, the lost city of gold. (<a href=#>Adriana Barraza</a>, part of the strong Latinx cast, brings grace to the role of Dora and Diego’s abuelita.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46dpquZXZa7pXnToZxmpJ%2BowW6vyK2wZqeWYrSwuMNmpKiumZp6s7HVopywZWJlfno%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
