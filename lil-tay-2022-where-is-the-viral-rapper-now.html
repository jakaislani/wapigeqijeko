She claimed to be a rapper working with big names like Chief Keef and boasted about her lavish lifestyle. However, she mysteriously disappeared from social media in the summer of 2018, leaving her fans wondering what happened to her. Here is what we know about Lil Tay’s whereabouts in 2022.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The rise and fall of Lil Tay</strong></h3><p>Lil Tay, whose real name is Claire Hope, was born on July 29, 2008, in Canada. She moved to Los Angeles with her mother, Angela Tian, who worked as a real estate agent. According to The Cut, Lil Tay became famous after a video of her and two other rappers, Woah Vicky and Bhad Bhabie, went viral. The video showed the trio having a heated argument in a mall parking lot. Lil Tay stole the show by asking “You tryna fight?” and throwing insults at Bhad Bhabie.</p><p>The video catapulted Lil Tay to online fame, and she soon gained millions of followers on Instagram and YouTube. She posted more videos of herself bragging about her wealth and cursing at her haters. She also appeared on Good Morning America with her mother and defended her controversial behavior. She said she was just following her dreams and being herself.</p><p>However, Lil Tay’s fame came at a price. Her videos sparked backlash from many people who accused her of being disrespectful, fake, and exploited by her mother. Some of her videos were exposed as staged, and it was revealed that she used her mother’s boss’s cars and houses without permission. Her mother was fired from her job as a result. Lil Tay also faced legal issues from her estranged father, Christopher Hope, who sued for custody and tried to stop her from making videos.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Lil Tay’s disappearance and rumors</strong></h3><p>In June 2018, Lil Tay’s social media accounts were wiped clean, except for one post on Instagram that read “Help me”. The post was later deleted, and no further explanation was given. Her fans were left in the dark about what happened to her and why she stopped posting.</p><p>Since then, there have been many rumors and speculations about Lil Tay’s whereabouts and well-being. Some people claimed that she was in foster care, in rehab, or even dead. Others believed that she was planning a comeback or working on new music. However, none of these rumors have been confirmed by Lil Tay or her family.</p><p>The only time Lil Tay resurfaced on social media was in April 2021, when a cryptic message appeared on her Instagram story. The message said “We have bad news about Tay…” but did not elaborate further. The message sparked concern among her fans who feared for the worst. However, no follow-up message was posted, and Lil Tay remained silent.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Lil Tay’s current situation in 2022</strong></h3><p>As of November 2022, Lil Tay has not been seen or heard from in any new social media videos or interviews. The rumors that she had returned to social media in 2022 were based on old clips from a 2018 interview that resurfaced on TikTok. The clips showed Lil Tay talking about being one of the youngest rappers in the industry with Zach Sang Show. However, these clips were not new and did not indicate that Lil Tay had made a comeback.</p><p>According to Hollywood Mask, Lil Tay is currently living with her father in Canada and is homeschooled because she is too famous. Her father has full custody of her and has banned her from making any more videos until she is 18 years old. He also has control over her finances and assets. Lil Tay’s mother is still fighting for custody and visitation rights.</p><p>Lil Tay’s fans are still hoping that she will return to social media someday and share her side of the story. They are also curious about whether she will pursue her rap career or choose a different path. Until then, Lil Tay remains one of the most mysterious and controversial figures on the internet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfobatedOasGZqYGd%2FbsPHnqmeZZmoerW0xGatoqqRoXqzrc%2BpnKtlnqTEcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
