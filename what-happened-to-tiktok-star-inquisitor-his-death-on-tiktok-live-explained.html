Videos uploaded by users claiming to have inside information in the days that followed claimed that the intervention came too late, and that the 23-year-old internet personality had died.</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>Inquisitor, also called Inquisitor Ghost and Inquisitore3, has gained a following of close to 200,000 devotees on TikTok, thanks to his series of posts cosplaying as the character Simon “Ghost” Riley from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty franchise</a>. His content often incorporates song, dance, and the regular addition of a red lightsaber to the traditionally Sith-free ensemble.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true>In September, allegations that Inquisitor had displayed grooming-adjacent behavior hit the message boards. The source was the TikTok star’s former editor, a 17-year-old who posted screenshots of their alleged conversations, in which Inquisitor made comments about loving the teenager and wanting to marry her.</p><p data-characters=560 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>The internet being a terrible place, it wasn’t long before further text messages were uploaded, this time allegedly between Inquisitor’s former editor and her boyfriend, in which the two conspired to bait the cosplayer by drumming up flirtatious interactions in order to get him canceled. Both Inquisitor and his former editor became targets of harassment online as a result of these posts. At present, everything about this story – the texts, the other texts, and even the live video posted by Inquisitor – are all unverified in any official capacity.</p><h2 id=h-fans-respond-to-the-reported-death-of-inquisitor data-injectable=false>Fans respond to the reported death of Inquisitor</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@hellomrfranco href=#>@hellomrfranco</a><p>Thats the most evil thing i could think of to do to someone.
