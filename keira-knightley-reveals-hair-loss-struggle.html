It got so bad that my hair literally began to fall out of my head," Knightley, 31, told <a href=#>InStyle UK</a>. "So for the past five years I've used wigs, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened to my hair."</p><p>Knightley said she has experienced a lot of changes in her body since having her adorable <a href=#>daughter</a>, Edie, in May 2015, but it seems her hair is recovering nicely from all that color-created trouble. "I have naturally crazy, curly hair, and since I've had the baby it's become 10 times thicker," she told InStyle . "So now I've been finding quite a lot of dreadlocks."</p><p>Knightley has openly discussed other beauty challenges too. "I didn't do anything with my skin until I started getting acne, at which point I did everything possible to get rid of it," she admitted. "I tried a million products, but none of them worked. I had bad skin up until I was 25. I later learned it was more about diet and hormonal changes." She added, "My skin has also become significantly drier with age, so I moisturise and I try to drink as much water as possible."</p><p>The actress previously confessed to <a href=#>Elle</a> that it took motherhood to make her comfortable with her body and appearance. "As a woman, you hate certain parts of your body. You go through those periods where you look in the mirror and you think, 'Oh, if only I had different legs or arms or whatever. You go through pregnancy and labor and then feeding the kid and you go, 'Wow, my body is totally amazing, and I'm never going to not like it again, because it did this, and this is **king extraordinary.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2plbIZwt8SiqZplm6O2qLTTpZyyZaKaw6aty6xkoZmZp3qtu9KsZKysoqq0qLjEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
