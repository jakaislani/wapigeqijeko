He impressed Blake and fellow coaches </span><a href=# rel>Kelly Clarkson</a><span>, </span><a href=# rel>Niall Horan</a><span> and </span><a href=# rel>Chance the Rapper</a><span>&nbsp;with his energetic rendition of Marvin Gaye's "I Heard It Through the Grapevine."</span></p><p><span>"Alex had personal reasons that he had to bow out of the competition," Blake shared. "It's never easy to see artists going home, but Neil has a ton of charisma. He did a great job today."</span></p><p><span>He also poked fun at an old frenemy when he praised Neil for going with the flow with his&nbsp;performance, noting, "I told him backstage, if you lose this Battle, it will be the worst fail in history. I mean, like, </span><a href=# rel>Adam Levine</a><span>-levels of failure."</span></p><p><a href=# rel>ET spoke&nbsp;with the season 23 coaches</a><span>&nbsp;ahead of the premiere, who all shared how excited they were to be on the show for&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel>Blake's&nbsp;last go-round</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>"I texted him," Kelly shared. "If&nbsp;he was gonna do a last season,&nbsp;I wanted to make sure I was there."</span></p><p><span>However, the talk show host&nbsp;insisted&nbsp;that she won't be letting nostalgia affect her competitive nature.</span></p><p><span>"If [Blake] wins, I am very happy for him, because that is super cool to win on the last season and he's literally the show, from its conception," she conceded. "But, like, I'm not, like, rooting for him to win. I'll be happy for him if he does, but I'm obviously trying to win myself."</span></p><p><span>As for&nbsp;the show's new coaches, Niall and Chance said they were ready to put&nbsp;in the work against the Team Blake dynasty.</span></p><p><span>"It's been awesome," Chance said of joining the show. "Kelly's very, very sweet, very nice to me. And Blake is... here."</span></p><p><span>The Voice</span><span>&nbsp;airs Mondays at 8 p.m. PT/ET and Tuesdays at 9 p.m. PT/ET on NBC.</span></p><p><strong><span>RELATED CONTENT:</span></strong></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>TV</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Blake Shelton Shares What He'll Miss Most About 'The Voice'</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>Music</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Kelly Clarkson Talks New Music and Blake's Last Season of 'The Voice'</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>TV</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>'The Voice' Season 23 Team Rosters: Watch All the Battle Rounds!</span></h3></a><p class=label>Video</p><a class=title href=#>'The Voice': Jimmy Fallon Surprises the Coaches With a Blind Audition</a>Related Photos<a href=# aria-label="'The Voice': The Complete Winners List"><span class=slidecount>24 Photos</span></a><a href=# aria-label="'The Voice': The Complete Winners List"><span>'The Voice': The Complete Winners List</span></a><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7psDOp6OippVjsLC5jq2fnmWmpLaksYytnJqlXZe5orfErGSanJGieri0wKWcp2WUp7yxv4yorK1lkpqzsL7EZpmarKShsm6%2Bzq6lnWWgmr%2Bnu9GmmKeblWK7prXLZqqapKOesKl5z56pn6eiosA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
