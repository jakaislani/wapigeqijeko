Scroll below and check more detailed information about Current Net worth as well as Monthly/Year Salary, Expenses, Income Reports!</span></h3><h2><span id=Jac_Collinsworth_Family_Education_Early_Life>Jac Collinsworth Family & Education Early Life</span></h2><p>The son of Cris Collinsworth and Holly Collinsworth, Jac Collinsworth. Similarly, Cris is a former NFL player who spent eight seasons as its wide recipient for the Cincinnati Bengals. His girlfriend, Holly, is a lawyer, on the other hand.</p><p>In addition, Cris’s brother Austin Collinsworth and sisters Ashley Collinsworth and Katie Collinsworth are three siblings with whom he grew up. His brother Austin was also playing football at Notre Dame, as was his old man, while his sister Ashley was at Harvard track and field squad.</p><p>In May 2017, Cris studied at Notre Dame University, where he completed his studies in film, television, and theater. During his tenure at the Dame, Collinsworth hosted the college football team with a weekly digital ND Live series.</p><h2><span id=Jac_Collinsworth_A_work_ESPN_ACC_Network>Jac Collinsworth: A work ( ESPN & ACC Network)</span></h2><p>Jac’s sports media career began while he was still at Notre Dame. To clarify, he interviewed players on his weekly podcast with Notre Dame Football on Showtime’s A Season. Collinsworth also filed weekly athletes’ features for the nationally unionized television program Inside Notre Dame Football.</p><p>He also covered the NFL Network’s initiative called Notre Dame Pro Day between 2016 and 2017. That’s not everything, however, because Jac served as a Sideline Assistant Producer for employers of his father, NBC’s coverage of the football matches at Notre Dame.</p><p>After his graduation, Collinsworth assumed the position of host and reporter at ESPN. In addition, Jac interviewed star coaches and players who helped highlight their personalities in somewhat unconventional environments. He was also hosting the 2019 ESPN ACC Network, The Huddle.</p><h2><span id=Jac_Collinsworth_leaves_ESPN_ACC_Network_NBC_Sports>Jac Collinsworth leaves ESPN & ACC Network: NBC Sports.</span></h2><p>However, in March 2020, Jac quit his job at ESPN to work with his boss, NBC Sports, in the same organization. He will focus on a number of sports, from the web and new media, including Olympics, Notre Dame Football, and the NFL’s&nbsp;Jac signed up for NBC Sports, he said,</p><p>“I have been my coach for as long as I can remember my dad. We’re teammates now. Life isn’t getting any better than that. It’s nice to be home.”</p><p>Thus, from the above quotation, we can appreciate the love and the bond between the dad-son duo. So let us all hope that for a very long time Cris and his son will be fellow workers.</p><h2><span id=Jac_Collinsworth_age_body_measurements>Jac Collinsworth: age, body, measurements</span></h2><p>Sadly, the specifics of Jac’s date of birth have been kept secret. As a consequence, his age remains a mystery. What we remember, however, is that Collinsworth was born in the early 1990s.</p><p>On the opposite, the measurements of Jac’s body were also kept under wraps. But we can confidently tell from his pictures on Instagram that Collinsworth frequently hits the gym.</p><h2><span id=Jac_Collinsworth_Net_Worth_Salary>Jac Collinsworth Net Worth & Salary.</span></h2><p>We are sad to note that the net value of Collinsworth was not disclosed to the public. We cannot, therefore, send you the exact details of his bank balance. However, since Jac has been successful for more than seven years in the broadcasting industry, we can safely claim that his net worth is around the seven-digit mark. His annual salary of $75,000 is further stressed as an ESPN Sunday NFL Countdown reporter. In March 2020, however, he left the job to join his boss, Cris, in NBC Sports.</p><h2><span id=How_much_does_Cris_Collinsworth_get_paid>How much does Cris Collinsworth get paid?</span></h2><p>Talking about Cris, he has a net worth of $20 million, which he amassed from his seven-year stay in the NFL along with his broadcasting career. But, unlike his son, who still gets paid an average reporter’s salary, Jac’s father takes home $4 million per year.</p><h2><span id=Jac_Collinsworth_Wife_Girlfriend>Jac Collinsworth Wife & Girlfriend</span></h2><p>Jac is an extremely private person when it comes to his personal relationships. Moreover, he has not shared a single detail about his relationships, be it past or present. But it’s a little difficult to claim that he’s married for sure.</p><p>However, rumors have been circulating that Collinsworth is in a relationship with his longtime girlfriend, Nicole De Francisco. But, sadly, there are no concrete details to confirm the fact.</p><p>Nonetheless, judging from his handsome looks and successful career, we are pretty confident that Jac would be able to woo any girl he liked. That said, if Collinsworth is in a relationship with Nicole, we wish him every success in his relationship.</p><h2><span id=Quick_facts>Quick facts</span></h2><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto" class=mytable width=100%><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Jac Collinsworth</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td>November 16, 1983</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>Fort Thomas, Kentucky, U.S.A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nick Name</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Religion</strong></td><td>Christian</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>White</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td>Notre Dame University</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Horoscope</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td>Holly Collinsworth</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td>Austin Collinsworth, Katie Collinsworth, Ashley Collinsworth</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shoe Size</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Blonde</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Body Measurement</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Build</strong></td><td>Athletic</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Married</strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><b>Girlfriend</b></td><td>Nicole De Francisco ( Rumored)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spouse</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Children</strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Sports Broadcasting</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Position</strong></td><td>Host & Reporter</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Salary</strong></td><td>$75,000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Social Media</strong></td><td><a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Twitter</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shoes</strong></td><td>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Joan M.
