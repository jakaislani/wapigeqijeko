While the exact cause of his death remains undisclosed at this time, the impact of his loss is profoundly felt. Taste of Maine, a local restaurant, expressed their condolences and prayers for Bryan’s family, emphasizing his role as the “best soccer OFD ever” and his remarkable influence on numerous lives.</p><p>Morse & Doak Builders, established in 1976, has been a pillar of the broader Midcoast area, providing a wide array of residential contracting services. The company was co-founded by Elliott Morse, Gregory Doak, Bryan Hayward, and Darius Doak. They have diligently led a team of highly skilled and knowledgeable crew members, undertaking a diverse range of residential projects, including historical renovations, general remodeling, and new home construction.</p><p>Bryan Hayward’s journey with Morse & Doak Builders began in 1980 when he joined as a temporary summer worker. Growing up, Bryan assisted his father, Frank, in maintaining the physical facilities of Chop Point Camp and School in Woolwich. This early experience instilled a strong work ethic in Bryan and equipped him with a diverse skill set for various repair techniques. His tenure began part-time at Morse and Doak Woodworkers and gradually evolved into a full-time role during the 1980s. In 1991, Bryan became a member of the ownership group, coinciding with the company’s incorporation as Morse and Doak Builders.</p><p>The passing of Bryan Hayward has left a void in the Woolwich community and the residential construction industry. His dedication, skills, and contributions to the growth and success of Morse & Doak Builders Inc. will be fondly remembered and deeply missed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kr7PFwKdkoZmprK6zsIyomaKspZa%2FunnOsKWeql2ks27AwKyrnmWfm3qurcinnGaokajApr%2BMmq6asV2irqq6xGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
