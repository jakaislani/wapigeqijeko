But before she was fired IRL, the controversial pop culture figure walked down the aisle at Trump International Hotel in D.C. to wed Pastor John Allen Newman in April 2017. (We couldn't have imagined that after the dreamy, albeit, slightly offbeat wedding, that she would eventually release a scathing tell-all about Trump based on a bunch of secretly recorded tapes, but hey, 2018 is wild.)</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, we’ve caught you up with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>everything you need to know about Omarosa</a>, but we also thought we’d take a look back at her big day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Below, a brief trip down memory lane.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-location></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Location</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Omarosa married Newman — her second husband — at Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., where she walked down the aisle in a lace pink dress, all while she was employed at the White House. She originally intended to get married in Jacksonville in March 2017, but changed her plans after facing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>death threats</a>. Was Trump there? Nah, he was at his Palm Beach resort Mar-a-Lago doing whatever it is he does there (read: golf).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-guests></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Guests</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Washington Post</a>, there were about 150 guests, including celebrities like Real Housewives of Atlanta star Phaedra Parks and Trump’s former campaign manager and current adviser, Kellyanne Conway.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-dress></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Dress</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because reality TV stars apparently can’t stay away from the camera, Omorosa participated in an episode of TLC’s Say Yes to the Dress, working with her friends and family, not to mention host Randy Fenoli, to find the one. As you’ll see in the clip below, she eventually settled on an embellished blush Ysa Makino design that, according to the show, was valued at $6,400.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Deadline</a> reported that Say Yes to the Dress made an exception for Omarosa and instead of making her pay for her own gown, simply handed it over. White House financial disclosures revealed that she “received a wedding package which included a wedding dress, custom veil, and accessories with an estimated value of $25,000 in exchange for appearance on TLC’s Say Yes to the Dress.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Yahoo!</a> pointed out, receiving money for an appearance could have posed serious ethical concerns for the former White House official, however, Omarosa filmed her segment of Say Yes before Trump’s January 2017 inauguration. (Ethical issues related to clothing? Sounds familiar ... *cough* Paul Manafort *cough.* )</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-bridal-party></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Bridal Party</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Omarosa also had a bridal "going away" party before her wedding with none other than aides close to the president. Guests included Conway and White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-probably-unauthorized-photo-shoot></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Probably Unauthorized Photo Shoot</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Months after the wedding, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Politico</a> reported that Omarosa brought her bridal party of 39 to the White House following her ceremony for a photo shoot in the Rose Garden and West Wing. The problem? Many senior advisors were not aware of the photoshoot, and they ultimately banned her from sharing any of the images. Apparently, the incident only brought the Trump’s administration’s Office of Public Liaison under further scrutiny.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeimsOqv8itoKefXaS6or7OrJhmpZGjtqit1KWrZq%2BVmbGqusZmq6utnaV6qbvTnqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
