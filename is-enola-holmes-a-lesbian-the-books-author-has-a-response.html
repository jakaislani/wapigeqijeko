As it stands, many people seem to interpret the character as being queer-coded, with some even affirming that she is a lesbian. The speculation online was—and still is—incessant, eventually leading Nancy Springer to take a stance on this subject.</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=777 data-injectable=true>In June, the author manifested her displeasure with people who act as if they have a clear-cut answer regarding Enola’s sexuality, feeling that her work is being disrespected. That said, Springer claims that everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and people are free to read the character as they please…as long as they don’t express their interpretations as some sort of irrefutable truth.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Readers who imagine <a href=#>#EnolaHolmes</a> is going to marry Tewksbury are entitled to their dreams. Readers who imagine <a href=#>#EnolaHolmes</a> is lesbian are entitled to their dreams. But it quite thoroughly irritates me when they proclaim these dreams as some sort of Truth.

Being 14 years old, the character has not yet experienced enough to even consider her sexuality, and the author claims that will remain the case for some years to come.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Some of my readers (and watchers of the <a href=#>#EnolaHolmes</a> movie) need to remember that she is a young lady raised in the Victorian era, which means she is an innocent, has never been kissed, is a virgin, and will remain untroubled and clueless about matters sexual for several years.</p>— Nancy Springer (@NancySpringer) <a href=#>July 26, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true>One could argue that sexual experience isn’t required for someone to understand their own sexuality, but it’s easy to understand where the author is coming from.
