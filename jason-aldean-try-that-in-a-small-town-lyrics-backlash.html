The song describes "good old boys" who "take care of their own" and won't tolerate disrespect of the police or the American flag, and draws a clear line between small-town America, which it purports are populated by proud owners of guns which they won't give up, and big cities where it is suggested that unpatriotic lawlessness rules.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Much of the iconography of the song will be familiar to anyone who has listened to a country music radio station, although some of the specifics have been deemed distasteful by listeners. Specifically, the pro-gun message of "Try That in a Small Town" is being questioned because Aldean was present at the mass shooting at the Route 91 music festival on the Las Vegas Strip in 2017.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While "Try That in a Small Town" was released on May 19, the controversy surrounding the song arose on July 14, after Aldean put out an accompanying music video.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When u grow up in a small town, it’s that unspoken rule of 'we all have each other’s backs and we look out for each other,'" Aldean explained in a tweet promoting the music video. "It feels like somewhere along the way, that sense of community and respect has gotten lost. Deep down we are all ready to get back to that."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Aldean added that he hopes the music video for "Try That in a Small Town" makes people feel less alone in wanting to go back to that way of life—although his choice of location for the video, the site of the public murder of a Black man, did not go unnoticed.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Jason Aldean shot this at the site where a white lynch mob strung Henry Choate up at the Maury County Courthouse in Columbia, Tenn., after dragging his body through the streets with a car in 1927," wrote journalist Ashton Pittman on Twitter. "That's where Aldean chose to sing about murdering people who don't respect police."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While some believed the video for "Try That in a Small Town" highlighted the racial undertones of the song, turning uncomfortable subtext into actual text, others found the entire sensibility of the song to be lacking in classic country authenticity: a number of commentators have pointed out that Aldean is singing a small-town anthem despite the fact that he actually hails from the city of Macon, Georgia and now lives in Nashville, Tennessee.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Author Matthew Chapman wrote that "this song absolutely captures everything about the American Right, from the paranoid threats of violence, to the irrational fetishization of communities where everyone acts and thinks the same, to the fact that the singer in fact grew up in a city."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"If country singers want to sing the praises of small towns, and about how life is quieter and simpler compared to living in the city, that’s obviously their right," wrote Brian Richards for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pajiba.com/web_culture/jason-aldean-really-loves-small-towns.php data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Pajiba class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Pajiba</a>. "But when your praise of small towns involves fearmongering, and encouraging white people to lash out and go after anyone who looks or sounds differently than they do with guns, and with bills being signed into law, you deserve whatever smoke you get."</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He added: "The mass shootings that keep happening over and over and over again in this country... <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://bakersfieldnow.com/news/local/why-mass-school-shootings-continue-to-happen-in-small-towns data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="They mostly happen in small towns" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">They mostly happen in small towns</a>."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As the conversation around "Try That in a Small Town" was gathering heat, so, too was Aldean: The singer ran off stage mid-performance on July 16 due to heat exhaustion, and is currently recovering.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a9c051f1-4c74-4259-8cc9-6e25552ff44e_1573063151.png alt="Headshot of Philip Ellis" title="Headshot of Philip Ellis" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Philip Ellis is News Editor at Men's Health, covering fitness, pop culture, sex and relationships, and LGBTQ+ issues.
