Costco rocks. And not just for the lack of judgment. The store’s own proprietary products are usually pretty darn good—and that includes Costco pastries and other delights from the Costco bakery. I took the contents of my aforementioned cart back to the Sporked offices and tasted 11 different Costco baked goods, including cult-favorite Costco bakery cookies, Costco Danish pastries, Costco croissants, and Costco muffins. What’s the best? What’s the worst? What should you definitely buy a full palate of the next time you visit everyone’s favorite warehouse? Find out in this ranking of Costco bakery items, from worst (although, who are we kidding, how bad can a baked good be?) to best.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="costco Mixed Berry and Cheese Turnovers" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BEST_COSTCO_BAKED_GOODS_INSET_07.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Berry & Cheese Turnovers</strong></p><strong>Mixed Berry and Cheese Turnovers</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>These sizable turnovers look great. But the pastry itself is greasy on the outside and somehow still dry on the inside. And the berry filling tastes fake. Still, the sweet cheese in the mix is creamy and good. If I was handed one of these Costco pastries, I would eat some of it and not complain. But I would advise against buying them for your office snack day.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="costco Caramel Apple Mini Cakes" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BEST_COSTCO_BAKED_GOODS_INSET_02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Caramel Apple Mini Cakes</strong></p><strong>Caramel Apple Mini Cakes</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Pronto</a><p>These mini cakes (aka cupcakes you can eat for breakfasts) are topped with frosting, a scoop of <a href=#>apple filling</a> (fruit means it’s okay to eat one for breakfast), and a drizzle of caramel. The frosting is light and airy buttercream. The cake tastes like salted caramel. There’s a lot going for these—but then you get hit with a weird aftertaste, almost like too much baking soda was used. And there’s just not enough apple. I was hoping for apple chunks in the cake, but they seem to only be on top. Plus, they’re just way too big. No one can or should eat a whole one of these mini cakes and cutting them is a hassle.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>6/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="costco Double Chocolate Muffins" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BEST_COSTCO_BAKED_GOODS_INSET_03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Double Chocolate Muffins</strong></p><strong>Double Chocolate Muffins</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Costco</a><p>These Costco muffins are massive (as most things in Costco are), but unlike the mini cakes, you can easily slice one in half for a more reasonable portion. Each muffin is studded with chocolate chunks that have a great bittersweet flavor. I am a big fan of these chunks. Sadly, the muffin itself is just a bit dry. But if you take advantage of the two-pack deal on Costco muffins and this is one of the packs, they’ll definitely get eaten and no one will complain.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>6.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="costco Almond Filled Danish" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BEST_COSTCO_BAKED_GOODS_INSET_05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Almond Filled Danish</strong></p><strong>Almond Filled Danish</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Costco</a><p>If you eat pastries just as an excuse to eat powdered sugar, then I have the Costco Danish for you. This comes absolutely covered in powdered sugar—like, good luck eating one if you’re wearing dark colors. I totally love almond pastries, so I had high hopes for this one. But the almond paste is too sweet without enough almond flavor to balance out the pure sugar. The pastry itself is tender and buttery and crispy in just the right places, though.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="costco Chocolate Chip Cookie" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BEST_COSTCO_BAKED_GOODS_INSET_09.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Chocolate Chip Cookies</strong></p><strong>Chocolate Chip Cookies</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Costco</a><p>Costco chocolate chip cookies have a cult following. So there are going to be a lot of people angry at me for my placement of these Costco bakery cookies. Don’t think of it as a ding on the cookie, think of it as a celebration of how extremely good all the other Costco bakery items are that are coming in ahead of it. The cookie is filled with chocolate chunks rather than chips—that’s great. They’re creamy and dark and rich. This is a classic supermarket soft cookie, but it doesn’t have too much of that supermarket cookie aftertaste. It’s a good cookie! It’s a really good <a href=#>supermarket chocolate chip cookie</a>! But there are better Costco baked goods and even better Costco bakery cookies available.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="costco White Chocolate and Macadamia Nut Cookie" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BEST_COSTCO_BAKED_GOODS_INSET_11.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>White Chocolate Cookie</strong>s</p><strong>White Chocolate and Macadamia Nut Cookies</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Costco</a><p>I am not a big fan of white chocolate, but the white chocolate in these Costco bakery cookies actually tastes like cocoa butter. Yes, the white chocolate chunks are very, very sweet, but they’re more complex than that. And there’s lots of them. Personally, I also like the actual cookie part of these Costco bakery cookies more than the chocolate chip cookies—it’s chewier and softer and more like a fresh-baked cookie. If you’re a white chocolate fan, get these Costco cookies ASAP.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="costco Croissants" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BEST_COSTCO_BAKED_GOODS_INSET_08.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Butter <strong>Croissants</strong></p><strong>Butter Croissants</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Costco</a><p>We got 12 Costco croissants for $5.99—that’s a pretty good deal for some pretty good croissants. They’re not crispy on the outside like fresh-baked croissants, but they taste buttery, the texture inside is chewy, and they are very big. They’re great for croissant sandwiches or you can pop them in a toaster oven to crisp them up a bit for a breakfast treat. They’re not the best Costco pastries out there, but they’re good to have around.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="costco Pumpkin Spice Loaf" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BEST_COSTCO_BAKED_GOODS_INSET_01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Pumpkin Spice Loaf</strong></p><strong>Pumpkin Spice Loaf</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Pronto</a><p>If you plopped this frosted pumpkin spice loaf on a plate and presented it to your family, they would give you a round of applause.

It’s very spiced with lots of nutmeg and cinnamon in the mix.
