Lizzy Caplin voices socially awkward scientist Reagan Ridley as she deals with her misfit team whilst trying to make the world a better place. The show‚Äôs logline reads: ‚ÄúFor employees of the Deep State, conspiracies aren‚Äôt just theories ‚Äî they‚Äôre fact.

It had been announced back in June of 2022 that along with part two on the way, fans could expect to see a second season of Inside Job on the books, though that decision now appears to have been reversed, leaving fans upset and a little angry which is understandable given that season one ended on a cliffhanger.</p><p data-characters=50 data-current-count=50 data-injectable=false>You can catch season one of Inside Job on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yvsdOfo6Kwo2Kur7XMmquenF2osrO1xKxkoqajnrGmecmomWagkah6o7HEp2ScmZ6Ysq2xw2abnqugnsGmedKemKynnmKyr7DIp55mp55isK21xZ%2BfmqaXmr9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
